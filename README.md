The first concept is ABC Pareto: 

In materials management, ABC analysis is an inventory categorization technique. ABC analysis divides an inventory into three categories—"A items" with very tight control and accurate records, "B items" with less tightly controlled and good records, and "C items" with the simplest controls possible and minimal records.

The ABC analysis provides a mechanism for identifying items that will have a significant impact on overall inventory cost,[1] while also providing a mechanism for identifying different categories of stock that will require different management and controls.

ABC analysis categories
There are no fixed thresholds for each class, and different proportions can be applied based on objectives and criteria. ABC Analysis is similar to the Pareto principle in that the 'A' items will typically account for a large proportion of the overall value, but a small percentage of the number of items.[3]
Examples of ABC class are

'A' items – 20% of the items accounts for 80% of the annual consumption value of the items
'B' items – 30% of the items accounts for 25% of the annual consumption value of the items
